Creating a game in Pygame that involves simulating the trajectory of a ball based on different gravitational forces on different celestial bodies is quite complex. It requires using calculus to calculate the path of the ball as it moves through space, taking into account the varying gravitational pull of each celestial body.

Imagine trying to throw a ball on Earth, where gravity pulls it down in a predictable arc. Now, imagine trying to throw that same ball on the Moon or Mars, where the gravity is weaker or stronger than on Earth.

To simulate this in Pygame, we need to calculate the trajectory of the ball using formulas that take into account the gravitational force of each celestial body. This involves complex mathematical calculations that determine how the ball moves and interacts with the environment in the game.
